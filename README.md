# Repository Description: OneBitCode School Course - Netflix Clone

Welcome to the OneBitCode School Course repository! This repository was created to store the files and resources related to the programming course offered by OneBitCode School.
As a Junior Developer eager to learn, I am excited to share this project with you, which involves creating a clone of the popular streaming platform, Netflix.

The main goal of this course is to provide beginner programmers, like myself, with hands-on experience in developing a complete web application.
By building a Netflix clone, we will gain practical knowledge in various areas of web development, such as front-end and back-end technologies, managing databases, implementing user authentication, and handling content streaming.

Within this repository, you will find a collection of code, documentation, and additional materials that will guide us through the course curriculum.
Whether you are starting your programming journey or seeking to improve your skills, this course offers a great opportunity to learn and grow.

Key Features:

- Full source code for the Netflix clone project
- Design assets and resources
- Code snippets for specific functionalities

Please keep in mind that this repository is intended solely for educational purposes and is not officially affiliated with Netflix or its development team.
The content provided here is meant to support our learning and practice.

Feel free to explore the different branches, commits, and issues within this repository to follow along with the project's progression and track our own progress.
Don't hesitate to engage in discussions, ask questions, or suggest improvements. The OneBitCode community and I are here to support each other throughout this learning journey.

Let's dive in and start coding together!
